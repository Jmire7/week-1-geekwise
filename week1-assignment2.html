		<h2>Objective</h2>
		<p>The idea is to pick 3 of my most treasured websites and do a comparison between all 3. I am to look and compare what I like about them and what I dislike. Does it run smooth? Is it pleasing to the eyes? Am I able to navigate and find what I need? Questions like this I am tasked to answer. Let's get right to it.</p>
		
		<a href='https://www.youtube.com' target='_blank'><h2>Youtube</h2></a>

		<p>I go to this website on a consistent basis (who doesn't?). For the most part I consider their website to be pretty striaght forward, It has the option to go into dark mode, which I like. The navigation bar is where it is supposed to be. What I like a lot is that it is not difficult to find the search bar and it allows me to come in here and search what I need. Other than that, I do have some things that I don't like. I feel the home page is too cluttered, and there are too much info to take in. Also finding specific menus is kind of an annoying task to do. I also feel like the UI is not as robust and clean like other sites. </p>
		<h3 style='color:limegreen;'>Pros</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Accessable nav bar</li>
			<li>Cool features</li>
			<li>Dark Mode</li>
		</ul>
		<h3 style='color:red;'>Cons</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Too much going on</li>
			<li>Menus not easy to access</li>
			<li>Dated UI</li>
		</ul>
		
		<a href='https://www.techspot.com' target='_blank'><h2>TechSpot</h2></a>
		<img src="techspot-logo.png" alt="techspot" width="400" height="100">
		<p>This is my main technology website. I go here to get all the latest tech news from around the world. It focuses mainly on computer parts and gaming benchmarks. Recently it has started to add more news concerning daily tech and future tech. I love the simplicity of the website. On the nav bar you have all you need to look for what you need. From trending articles to downloads for your computer. Directly below that you have articels that are the main stories at the moment and from there you just scroll down through the various articles. Its simple and efficient. On the other hand, the search icon is almost hard to find and the articles are not in order by category and you cant filter them either. Also some articles carry ads with them.</p>
		<h3 style='color:limegreen;'>Pros</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Simple</li>
			<li>Easy to navigate</li>
			<li>Clean UI</li>
		</ul>
		<h3 style='color:red;'>Cons</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Where is the search bar?</li>
			<li>No filter option for articles</li>
			<li>Ads</li>
		</ul>

		<p>My go to when it comes to finding deals on PC components as well as getting inspired for future builds. This site has all you need as far as helping you to build a PC, whether you're a novice or an experienced builder. Recently, they have gone through some upgrades in their user interface and they are for the better. Nav bar is polished and easy to find the search icon as well as your menus. There are tabs that allow you to search on specifics. The attention to detail is great, they have pictures for parts that you may be looking for. If you are interested in having a go at your first pc build, this is a great site. Downside is they don't have updated prices all the time and they don't have resorces to help you build a PC like a step by step guide. </p>
		<h3 style='color:limegreen;'>Pros</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Polished User Interface</li>
			<li>Great search features</li>
			<li>User friendly</li>
			<li>Attention to detail</li>
			<li>Price comparison from multiple stores</li>
			<li>Community involvement</li>
		</ul>
		<h3 style='color:red;'>Cons</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Prices may not be up to date</li>
			<li>Lack of 'how to' resources</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Conclusion</h2>
		<p>There are many websites out there to choose from, these were but a few of my favorites. The sites we go to usually are sites that mean something to us for providing something that relates to who we are or what we do. These are my sites and they can change going forward. What about you, what are your favorite sites?</p>
